## Our Commitment to Transparency

Levers in the Cloud participates in affiliate marketing programs, which means we may earn commissions when you purchase products or services through links on this website. These commissions come at no additional cost to you—the price you pay is exactly the same whether you use our affiliate link or go directly to the vendor's website.

## How Affiliate Relationships Work

When we recommend a software platform or business tool, and that recommendation includes an affiliate link, we receive a commission if you make a purchase. This business model allows us to invest significant time in thorough testing, detailed analysis, and honest comparisons without charging subscription fees or putting our content behind a paywall.

## Our Editorial Independence

Here's what matters most: **our affiliate relationships never influence our recommendations or reviews.** We maintain complete editorial independence. If a tool doesn't deliver the results that matter—profitable growth, customer retention, increased lifetime value—we'll say so clearly, regardless of commission potential. Our reputation and your trust matter far more than any affiliate payment.

## Our Testing Standards

We only recommend products and services that meet our rigorous standards:

- **Hands-on testing:** We test tools in real business scenarios across multiple functions
- **Customer data analysis:** We review thousands of verified customer reviews from platforms like G2, Capterra, and Trustpilot
- **Results focus:** We evaluate whether tools actually drive business outcomes, not just complete tasks
- **Personal use standard:** We only recommend tools we'd confidently use in our own businesses

## Legal Compliance

This disclosure is made in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission's 16 CFR Part 255: "Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising." The FTC requires that we disclose any material connection between our site and the products or services we recommend.

## Our Promise

When you read a review on Levers in the Cloud, you're getting honest analysis from business professionals with decades of experience making software decisions with real consequences. Affiliate commissions support our work, but they never compromise our integrity or influence our recommendations.

If a tool earns our recommendation, it's because we believe it will help your business succeed—not because of the commission structure.

## Questions?

If you have questions about our affiliate relationships or how we evaluate products, we're happy to discuss them transparently.
