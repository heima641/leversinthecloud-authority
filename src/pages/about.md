You've bought the software.  
Your team has been trained.  
The dashboard looks impressive.  
But six months later, you're still asking: "Where's the growth?"  
After three decades managing teams, budgets, and business growth initiatives, I started Levers in the Cloud because I was tired of watching good business leaders invest in tools that check boxes but don't move needles.  
This site exists to help you find software that actually drives profitable growth—not just efficient task completion.

## Our Story

I've spent over three decades managing teams and driving results across financial management, operations, product development, and marketing. Too often, I watched colleagues invest in platforms that promised transformation but delivered glorified task managers. The tools checked boxes and generated reports, but they didn't answer the questions that actually mattered—Are we growing profitably? Are we deepening customer relationships? Are we increasing lifetime value?

That gap frustrated me. Business leaders deserve honest guidance from someone who's been in their shoes—someone who's had to justify software investments to CFOs, manage teams through failed implementations, and explain to boards why expensive platforms didn't move the revenue needle.

As I transition into the next chapter of my career, my team and I are channeling that experience into helping small and medium business owners make smarter software decisions. Like many of you, we're building something that will outlast our corporate careers—a resource that serves leaders who value quality, integrity, and results over hype.

## What Makes This Site Different

**Real Business Experience, Not Tech Blogging**  
We're not affiliate marketers or tech enthusiasts—we're business professionals who've spent decades managing budgets, leading teams, and driving growth.

**Results Over Features**  
Most review sites list features and check boxes. We focus on the only questions that matter: Will this tool drive profitable growth? Will it deepen customer relationships and increase lifetime value? If a platform can't move those needles, we'll tell you—commission or not.

**Real-World Testing Across Functions**  
We test software the way your business actually uses it—across finance, operations, marketing, and customer service. This multi-functional perspective reveals integration issues, workflow gaps, and hidden costs that single-department reviews miss.

**Verified Customer Reviews at the Core**  
We analyze thousands of verified customer reviews from platforms like G2, Capterra, and Trustpilot before making recommendations. If real users consistently report problems, that matters more than any vendor's marketing promises.

**Servant Leadership Approach**  
Our team doesn't win until your team wins. We only recommend tools we'd confidently use in our own businesses, and we provide honest guidance even when it costs us commission revenue.

## How This Site Works

Let me be straightforward: some of the links on this site are affiliate links, which means we may earn a commission when you purchase through them—at no additional cost to you. Our commitment is simple: our recommendations are never for sale. We only recommend tools we'd confidently use in our own businesses, and we take the long-term view—your success matters more than any short-term commission.
